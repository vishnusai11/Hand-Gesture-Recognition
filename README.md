This is an implementation of a project to play Chrome's dinosaur game using Python and OpenCV.

I am a fresh graduate and was looking for fun projects to work on and learn at the same time in computer vision.Â 

I came across this project and another project that involved recognizing the 5 fingers shown at a webcam and replicated both to learn about the different functions involved.
